Endoscope viewer with a 3D aim indicator  (v6.0.1)

LAYOUT
    top-left      EXIT (every stage -- a touchscreen has no Escape key)
    top-right     aim indicator
    bottom-right  ZERO

HOW THE INDICATOR READS
    An azimuthal projection of the whole sphere onto a disc. The rim is
    horizontal, the centre is vertical, and the top of the disc is the
    direction you were facing when you zeroed.

        distance from centre   how close to horizontal the lens is
        angle around the disc  how far left or right of your zero heading
        arrow size             elevation: it grows aiming up, shrinks aiming down
        solid dot at centre    straight up
        hollow ring at centre  straight down

    Length alone cannot separate "aimed up" from "aimed down" -- both
    foreshorten identically -- so the arrow scale carries that sign. Reading
    the disc as though you were looking down on the probe from above, aiming
    up brings the tip toward you and it draws larger.

ELEVATION IS ABSOLUTE, HEADING IS RELATIVE
    Elevation comes from gravity, so it never drifts and never needs zeroing.
    Only the heading is measured against the zero reference, which is why the
    ZERO button stays reachable during use: heading is the only channel that
    can wander. In the live view ZERO re-captures the reference in place --
    aim forward, tap it, keep working.

WHY THERE IS A ZERO BUTTON AND NOT A MAGNETOMETER
    The BMM150 could give absolute heading, but this probe works around steel:
    engine bays, pipework, machinery. Magnetic heading there is worse than
    gyro drift.

WHAT v3 FIXES OVER v2 (v2 was written but never ran)
    - Indicator.draw() crashed with NameError on an undefined 'a0' the first
      time it rendered a needle. Fixed (arrow base = tip - arrow_len).
    - Stage changes leaked canvas items: ZERO pressed in the live view drew
      the check screen on top of the still-visible video and HUD. All
      transitions now run through set_stage(), which clears everything.
    - The serial link now connects and RECONNECTS by itself and the UI shows
      its state. The probe is USB-powered, so an unplug is a reboot: the
      quaternion restarts and any old zero is garbage. The app detects the
      restart and forces a re-zero instead of silently pointing wrong.
    - Startup no longer flushes the probe's status packets. ZERO is disabled
      (grey) until real attitude data is flowing, so a zero can no longer be
      captured from the identity quaternion.
    - Zeroing while steeply tilted leaves almost no horizontal reference for
      heading; the check screen now warns and asks for a level re-zero.
    - The check screen shows elapsed-time-since-zero and the peak heading
      excursion: leave the probe still and that number IS the drift, which is
      the measurement that decides whether this product works (HANDOFF §9.3).
    - Layout is computed from a running y-cursor instead of magic fractions;
      on the actual 1024x600 panel v2's check screen overlapped itself.
    - --sim runs the entire app against a synthetic probe.

class AxisDetector:
    """
    Identify which body axis the lens looks along, from one gesture.

    Two phases. ARMING: wait until the probe is held still for about half a
    second, then take THAT attitude as the baseline. Pressing ZERO involves
    hand motion, and v3.1 armed instantly with the zero attitude as baseline:
    a natural hand drop right after the press read as a 20-degree "tilt" and
    locked the BACKWARD axis -- which shows up as up/down inverted while
    left/right stays correct (field-observed 2026-09-03). Now nothing counts
    until the hand settles, and the UI tells the operator when to move.

    DETECTION: from the still baseline, when the operator TILTS THE LENS UP,
    the true forward axis -- and only it -- gains altitude. The first
    candidate to rise cleanly past TILT (winner at least MARGIN times the
    runner-up, held HOLD updates) is the lens axis. Because the lens was
    level at zero, the near-vertical body axes are never candidates.

    Rebasing also repairs the drop-then-lift sequence by itself: a probe that
    sagged 25 degrees before settling simply gets a lower baseline, and the
    lift back up still raises the true axis most.

    Remaining limit, set by geometry: from stillness, a deliberate tilt DOWN
    raises the backward axis with the same signature as a tilt up raises the
    forward one, and a deliberate pure twist raises a perpendicular axis.
    Attitude alone cannot tell those apart from the asked-for gesture, so the
    instruction ("tilt UP, don't twist") carries that last step, the
    right-turn check exposes a wrong lock within seconds, and RE-ZERO
    restarts detection. Mixed twist+tilt is rejected by the margin rule.

    Linux binds the UVC interface to `/dev/video*` and the CDC ACM interface to
    `/dev/ttyACM*`.  They are two interfaces of the same physical device, not
    two cables or two networks.  The camera reader and serial reader each keep
    only the newest sample, which bounds UI latency even after a slow frame.

    Owns the USB connection on a background thread: finds the port, opens it,
    demultiplexes the packet stream, and when the link dies -- cable pulled,
    board rebooted, port vanished -- closes, waits, and reconnects by itself.
    The UI never blocks on any of this; it just reads the published state.

    Only the newest frame and attitude are kept. Nothing queues: in a live
    view a late frame is worthless, so dropping is the correct policy.

    `generation` increments every time the probe (re)connects or announces a
    fresh boot. The probe is USB-powered, so losing the link means it lost
    power and its orientation estimate restarted from scratch -- any zero
    reference captured before that is garbage. The app compares generations
    to know when to force a re-zero.
